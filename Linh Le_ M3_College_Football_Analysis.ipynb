    "A different approach is to use **accumulator** variables. An accumulator variable is a variable that is modified in each iteration of the loop. For example, if you are storing the number of students for each university, outside of the loop you will define `n_students = 0` but within the loop you will increment the value of `n_students` for every university that matches your criteria. Incrementing and assigning back to the same variable can be done with the `+=` operator.\n",
